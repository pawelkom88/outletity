## About The Project
Outletity is a fake e-commerce store.

## Demo
Here is a working live demo with gif
## How I worked on this project
My goal was to simulate a professional work environment.
- I built this app based on Figma designs: [Design](https://www.figma.com/file/HEgT03d9Kht0SUWiPWVvD3/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1)
- I worked with tasks on a Trello board: [Kanban board]()
- I used feature branches and Pull Requests: []
## How to navigate this project
- Stateful logic: [Link to example code on GitHub]
- Responsive CSS using css-modules: [Link to example code on GitHub]
- The application fetches data from the Fake Store API: Examples for the request [link to code on
GitHub] and data transformation [link to code on GitHub]
- User data is saved in Firebase, which also handles authentication proccess. 
- Integration tests using React Testing Library: [Link to example test on GitHub]
## Why I built the project this way
E-commerce stores are ...

- I didn't use a state management library like Redux on purpose. For this app simple `useState` and built-in `useReducer` is sufficient. 
- CSS modules are great for styling. They scoped locally by default. To make styling easeir I used Sass for variables and mixins 
- My plan is to become a front-end developer eventually. I decided to use an existing API rather to create a custom server.
- Testing is an essential part of production applications. Testing Library is the go-to library in the React community. I covered the essential features of the app with tests.
